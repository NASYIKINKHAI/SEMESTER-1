 ### Reflection 

 ___________
The talk that was delivered by Ms. Qistina was about Credence Company which is a digital services company. The content of the talk shows the technology and tools that they have been using such as PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, and Metabase.  She also mentioned the skills that are required to be a system developer and explained to us what is the job scope for the system developer and it is really useful for us to determine what are the path that we are going to take in the future.
