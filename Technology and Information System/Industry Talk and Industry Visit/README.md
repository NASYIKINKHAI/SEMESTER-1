[UTMDigital Visit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zz6SNBAZlywSNyvFLzXraD2n1ov3aiiU?usp=drive_link) <br>


Having a visit to UTMDigital is a great opportunity for us as a computer science student and also as a UTM student. We get to utilize the UTMDigital visit to add up the knowledge we acquire in the classroom. For instance, through our visit to UTMDigital, we are able to view the database room where UTM stores its data as well as other technological advancements like smart TVs in their TM room space. They also gave us an explanation of how the staff works which is in a more relaxed environment to prevent any stress when doing their job which really amazes us. This visit made me understand that we understood that even with our massive project or workload, we still needed to get enough rest and have some entertainment.
