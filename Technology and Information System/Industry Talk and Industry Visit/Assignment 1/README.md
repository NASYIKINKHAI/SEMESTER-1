### Reflection
_______ <br>
***PPG Talk***<br>
From my point of view, through the activities of the PPG talk, we, students can get to know how the actual environment at the workplace. It is because they all share their experience of working for the company and what they do during working hours. These talks also exposed us to how to deal with customers, and manage projects. This conversation has made me recognize that as data engineering students, we need to communicate more effectively with others in order to provide better solutions for each project that we handle. <br><br>
***Petronas and Huawei Industrial Visit***<br>
The industry visit to Petronas and Huawei was beneficial to us who are still students.  We got to know about the software and technology that they utilize in their company as a result of this industrial visit. From this industry visit, we are being exposed to the new technology that they are producing, which encourages us to think more critically about how technology should be developed in the future to make our lives easier. They also described what it's like to work for a big company and gave us some motivation and our studies which will help us to be a great worker in the future.
