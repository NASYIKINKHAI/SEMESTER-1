### Reflection
________
In my opinion, this PC assemble lab is giving us much more benefit. We learn how to assemble and disassemble the PC in our class. From this activity, I got to know the components of the PC which are random access memory (RAM), hard disk drive (HDD), cable, and more. This activity allows us to tally what we learn in the class and create a better understanding about PC hardware.
